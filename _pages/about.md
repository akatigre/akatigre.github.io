Hello, I am a Ph.D candidate at [Machine Learning and Intelligence Lab](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/) (MLILAB) in KAIST, advised by [Prof. Eunho Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangeh/publications).

Currently my research interest lies in **human-friendly manipulation of images and videos**. More specifically, I am focusing on generating images in auto-regressive models, conditioned on text guidance.
